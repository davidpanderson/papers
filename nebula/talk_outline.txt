Title
SETI@home: algorithms and results

Abstract
SETI@home is a radio SETI sky survey.
It has three phases, of which two are completed.
From 2006 to 2020 we recorded baseband data at the Arecibo observatory,
divided it into chunks, and processed it using home computers -
at the peak, about a million of them.
We used this abundance of computing power to increase
the generality and sensitivity of the search:
we looked for 5 types of "detections",
using 15 octaves of frequency resolution,
and using coherent integration over a wide range of Doppler drift rates.
This produced a database of about 12 billion detections.

In the 2nd phase we identified and removed RFI,
then found and ranked "signal candidates":
group of detections, possibly spread over years,
that are close in sky position and frequency.
We used software "birdies" to guide algorithm development
and estimate overall sensitivity.
This phase had different computing requirements;
we used a Linux cluster in Germany.

The 3rd phase is ongoing; we're reobserving
the 100 highest-ranking signal candidates using the FAST telescope in China.
We're about halfway through this process and have not yet found an ET signal.

Who I am
    Academic computer scientist interested in distributed computing
    software jack of all trades 
    I had to learn some signal processing and radio astronomy

What we should have done differently

Advice for future radio sky surveys

Nebula
    might be useful for sky survey w/ commensal observing
