- The NDF model
    (intro: using Python notation)
    - Time
    - Score; tags
    - Note selectors
    - Piecewise functions of time
        - Linear PFT primitive
        - Exponential PFT primitive
        - Momentary PFT primitives
    - Transformations
        generally have:
            operator
            PFT
            Note selector
        nuance descriptions: a sequence of transformations

- Timing
    types of adjustment
        Tempo control
        Time shifts
        Articulation
    - Tempo control and pauses
    - Time shifts
    - Articulation
    - Layering timing adjustments

- Pedal control
    - Standard pedals
    - Virtual sustain pedals
    - Implementation and layering

- Dynamics
    ('volume' is OK; not loudness)
    types of adjustment
    adjust_pft()
    Layering

- Specifying nuance
    having a framework like NDF is necessary but not sufficient.
    two parts:
        tag score as needed (melodies, LH/RH)
        nuance structure
        editing:
            listen to a measure or two
            identify problem
            change something (like a parameter of a PFT)
        this needs to be easy; it will get done thousands of time
        At some point might change the structure, or add tages
    - Nuance structure
        a list of transformations with operator and selector,
            but PFTs unspecified
        goal:
            each layer has a purpose;
            if something is off, it's clear what layer to change
    The process of developing a nuance specification
        tag the score
            e.g. LH, RH; melodies
        define a nuance structure
        develop PFTs one transformation at a time (usually coarsest to finest)
            write initial PFT
            loop
                listen to the result
                tweak the PFT
        It may help to focus on one part at a time (e.g. RH)
            or on one section (e.g. a measure).
            When done with a section you might copy it
        you may need to change the structure

    Nuance scripting
        repetition, parameterization

    Editing interfaces
        (GUI, program)

    Numula

- Nuance inference
    idea:
        given a score and a performance of the score,
        find a simple nuance desc that approximates the performance
        what does "simple" mean?
        inherent nondeterminism
            is it a sequence of accents or a crescendo?
            a sequence of small pauses or a rit?
    terms
        tagged score
        constrained nuance structure
        complexity of a spec
        score rendition, error
    how to infer nuance
        volume
            fit long PFT primitives
                find start/end times, curve type, parameters
            given 'residue', fit shorter primitives
            fit accents to residue
        timing
            similar approach: long/short term tempo,
            then pauses, then shifts
        automated, manual, or hybrid
            e.g. manually say cresc from A to B,
            algorithm finds primitive and parameters
            may need to tweak nuance structure along the way

    applications of nuance inference
        Performance style analysis
            e.g. different performers playing same piece
                manually infer one or two to get a nuance structure;
                automatically infer others using same structure
            same performer playing different pieces
                find nuance 'signature'
            performers of different periods / nationalities/ conservatories
        find new primitives
