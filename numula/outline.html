    Nuance structure
        a list of transformations with operator and selector,
            but PTF unspecified
        goal:
            each layer has a purpose;
            if something is off, it's clear what layer to change
    The process of developing a nuance specification
        tag the score
            e.g. LH, RH; melodies
        define a nuance structure
        develop PFTs one transformation at a time (usually coarsest to finest)
            write initial PFT
            loop
                listen to the result
                tweak the PFT
        It may help to focus on one part at a time (e.g. RH)
            or on one section (e.g. a measure).
            When done with a section you might copy it
        you may need to change the structure

    idea:
        given a score and performance of the score,
        find a simple nuance spec that approximates the performance
        what does "simple" mean?
        inherent indeterminism
            is it a sequence of accents or a crescendo?
            a sequence of small pauses or a rit?

        constrained nuance structure

        score rendition, error
    how to infer nuance
        volume
            fit long PFT primitives
                find start/end times, curve type, parameters
            given 'residue', fit shorter primitives
            fit accents to residue
        timing
            similar approach: long/short term tempo,
            then pauses, then shifts
        automated, manual, or hybrid
            e.g. manually say cresc from A to B,
            algorithm finds primitive and parameters
            may need to tweak nuance structure along the way

    applications of nuance inference
        Performance style analysis
            e.g. different performers playing same piece
                infer one to get a nuance structure;
                in others using same structure
            same performer playing different pieces
                find signature nuance
            performers of different periods / nationalities/ conservatories
        find new primitives
