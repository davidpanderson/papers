Abstract

We present a model for describing musical 'nuance':
the deviation (in timing, dynamics, and other parameters)
between a musical score and a rendition.
The model is designed to allow compact expression
of complex and layered nuance,
as is typically present in human performance.
We describe an implementation of the model
in a Python library,
and discuss the applications and editing interfaces
for musical nuance.

Piecewise functions of time

Many components of nuance involve quantities
(like tempo and volume) that change over time.
To describe these, MNS 
A PFT is a list of 'primitives'
'Interval primitives' had nonzero time duration dt,
and typically describe a continuous function
over the interval [0, dt].
'Momentary primitives' have zero duration.

MNS uses two types of PFTs:

'Integral PFTs': these describe tempo and other timing nuance.
The value of the PFT represents the rate of change
of performance time with respect to score time.
The interval primitives
Each must provide a member function integral(t)
that returns the integral of the primitive from 0 to t.
The momentary primitives are like Dirac deltas
in the tempo function; they represent pauses,
or discontinuities in the map for score time to performance time.

'Value PFTs': these represent time-varying quantities such
as volume (relative or absolute).
The interval primitives must provice a member function value(t)
return the value at time t.
