A model for nuance description
    Scores
        time: score, real
        notes
        scores; tags
        measures
        note selectors
    PFTs
        value vs. integral
        primitives
        closure
    Timing
        goals:
            specify tempo functions as PFTs (tempo + pauses)
                functions from score time to tempo
            apply one to a score
            apply a second one
            apply one "normalized"
        tempo
        Layering
        pauses
            typically in a separate layer after tempo
            so that delay is performance time
        shift
            e.g. agogic accents, rolled chords
            same
    Volume
        continuous
        accents
        Layering
    Pedaling
        MIDI, virtual

Numula
    Shorthand notations

Structuring nuance specifications
    layers, short/long term, delay

User interfaces for editing nuance
    ideal
    program editing
    IPA (TUI; text-based user interface)

Applications of nuance specifications
    performance pedagogy
    virtual conductor
