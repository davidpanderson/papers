Specifying and inferring nuance in notated music

Abstract

Intro
    nuance in notated keyboard music
    its importance in some genres
    vague description in scores

    hi-res description of nuance
        high-level and concise
        as precise as possible, given that
            can closely approximate human performances
    why do we care:
        1) create specification for a new or existing pieces
            composition
            virtual performance
            pedagogy
        2) extract a specification from performance
            study performance style
            find useful primitives
    the structure of nuance
        continuous transformations
            tempo, dynamics
        discrete transformations
            tempo, dynamics
        layering

    NSL
        language for specifying the above
        defines
            an extensible set of continuous primitives
            the math of combining layers
            framework for other transformations
        Reference implementation: Numula

A model for nuance description
    Scores
        time: score, real
        notes
        scores; tags
        measures
        note selectors
    PFTs
        value vs. integral
        primitives
        closure
    Timing
        goals:
            specify tempo functions as PFTs (tempo + pauses)
                functions from score time to tempo
            apply one to a score
            apply a second one
            apply one "normalized"
        tempo
        Layering
        pauses
            typically in a separate layer after tempo
            so that delay is performance time
        shift
            e.g. agogic accents, rolled chords
            same
    Volume
        continuous
        accents
        Layering
    Pedaling
        MIDI, virtual

Numula
    Shorthand notations

Structuring nuance specifications
    layers, short/long term, delay

User interfaces for editing nuance
    ideal
    program editing
    IPA (TUI; text-based user interface)

Applications of nuance specifications
    performance pedagogy
    virtual conductor
