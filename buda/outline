Abstract

Intro
    BOINC
        summarize architecture
        client/app interface
        apps and app versions
            plan classes
            code signing
        packaging apps
        wrappers
        vbox
            issues: size, performance, no GPU access, proprietary
    container systems
        Docker and Podman
            images
            Dockerfiles
        host systems
            Win
                WSL
            Linux
            Mac
                QEMU

Supporting Docker-based apps in BOINC
    installing Docker on clients
        part of BOINC installer
        client: startup
    Selecting and running Docker apps
        detect Docker in the client
            Win
        report to server
        plan class
        report to app in init_data.xml
    docker wrapper
    cleanup
        client
    packaging Docker apps
        single-, multi-purpose

BUDA
    goals
